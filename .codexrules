# Codex Rules

- Always open and read this `.codexrules` file before taking any action.
- If changes are being made to the project:
  - First check and, if needed, update the requirements Markdown file.
  - Only after the requirements are up to date should you proceed to code changes.

# Notes
- Keep requirements in Markdown format and maintain them as current.
